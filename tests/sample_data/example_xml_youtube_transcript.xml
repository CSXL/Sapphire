spacewalk to fix a solar</text><text start="539.82" dur="3.48">panel with your big wrench and as you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="541.56" dur="3.779">heading out you get distracted by The</text><text start="543.3" dur="4.02">View and Miss grabbing the handle and</text><text start="545.339" dur="4.62">now you&amp;#39;re very slowly drifting away</text><text start="547.32" dur="4.32">what do you do to save yourself and you</text><text start="549.959" dur="3.841">might say well you just sort of swim</text><text start="551.64" dur="4.56">your way back but in zero gravity as</text><text start="553.8" dur="4.32">demonstrated here by an actual astronaut</text><text start="556.2" dur="4.079">you could flail your arms all you want</text><text start="558.12" dur="3.839">but your center of mass won&amp;#39;t actually</text><text start="560.279" dur="3.841">move alright so did you think of the</text><text start="561.959" dur="4.32">answer the trick is you throw the wrench</text><text start="564.12" dur="3.899">as fast as possible in the opposite</text><text start="566.279" dur="3.781">direction and that will give you just a</text><text start="568.019" dur="3.541">little push to slowly move you back to</text><text start="570.06" dur="3.42">the space station and this makes</text><text start="571.56" dur="3.24">intuitive sense right like if you&amp;#39;re on</text><text start="573.48" dur="2.88">a skateboard and you throw something</text><text start="574.8" dur="4.92">heavy to the right you&amp;#39;re gonna move</text><text start="576.36" dur="5.94">back to the left Nate you had one job</text><text start="579.72" dur="4.32">well this is exactly how Rockets move</text><text start="582.3" dur="3.3">around in space where there&amp;#39;s no air</text><text start="584.04" dur="3.299">they create a chemical reaction from</text><text start="585.6" dur="3.6">their fuel to make a lot of tiny</text><text start="587.339" dur="3.841">wrenches and they just throw them out of</text><text start="589.2" dur="4.139">the back really fast and the rocket</text><text start="591.18" dur="4.14">naturally has to go the other way just</text><text start="593.339" dur="3.481">like you as an astronaut so that&amp;#39;s one</text><text start="595.32" dur="3.18">thing you need to know and the other is</text><text start="596.82" dur="3.78">the kiwanda effect which states that</text><text start="598.5" dur="3.839">fluids like to curve and flow around a</text><text start="600.6" dur="3.359">smooth surface you actually already know</text><text start="602.339" dur="4.261">this if you&amp;#39;ve ever noticed how water</text><text start="603.959" dur="4.801">will flow around a curved spoon well air</text><text start="606.6" dur="4.02">is also a fluid and so it curves just</text><text start="608.76" dur="3.42">like water as you could see here because</text><text start="610.62" dur="3.6">the strings are following with the</text><text start="612.18" dur="4.02">airflow as it turns the round corner on</text><text start="614.22" dur="3.78">the Frisbee okay so now let&amp;#39;s put those</text><text start="616.2" dur="4.079">two concepts together from the ball&amp;#39;s</text><text start="618" dur="4.5">perspective air is rushing past on the</text><text start="620.279" dur="4.081">top side here and curving around really</text><text start="622.5" dur="4.5">nicely because the rotation of the ball</text><text start="624.36" dur="4.5">matches great with the airflow but on</text><text start="627" dur="3.839">the bottom side they&amp;#39;re opposite so</text><text start="628.86" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s sort of a head-on collision with</text><text start="630.839" dur="4.141">the air rushing by creating turbulence</text><text start="633.12" dur="3.899">that means more air curves around the</text><text start="634.98" dur="4.2">top which means more little air wrenches</text><text start="637.019" dur="3.961">are thrown diagonally down and as a</text><text start="639.18" dur="4.02">result the back spun ball moves</text><text start="640.98" dur="4.62">diagonally up just like the astronaut</text><text start="643.2" dur="4.56">causing it to curve up the fancy term</text><text start="645.6" dur="4.08">for this is the Magnus effect and big</text><text start="647.76"
